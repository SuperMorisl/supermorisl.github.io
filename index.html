            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm Maurice, currently in my 1st year of a Computer Science Bachelor's at the Catholic University of Louvain.<br><br>
                I've already worked on several projects and learned a lot, and I'm not planning to stop anytime soon.<br><br>
                I'm really passionate about tech and programming as I know Python, CSS, HTML, and C.<br><br>
                You can see my work a bit further down this page or directly on my 
                <a href="https://github.com/SuperMorisl" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.<br><br>
                And yes, you might notice I love adding music to some of my projects .

            My biggest project for the moment is the babyphone made in a team of 4 for University projects.<br>
            Here you have a photo and a link<a href="https://github.com/SuperMorisl/microbit" target="_blank"> to the github repo.</a><br>
            In this project we needed to build a babyphone by using 2 microbits, the difficulties was about the unknown because
            on this project we haven't know how to code really well in python but we were learning.<br>
            In term of technic the main difficulty was to pass a message from one baby phone to another and using vigener encryption and hashing the password to detect the messages
            that was sent from one microbit to another.<br>
            For more details and other projects you can see on my github.
